1. All P5 teams start with a rating of 1500 and all G5 teams start with a rating of 1200. Other, non-FBS teams, if encountered in the schedule, are added to the table starting with a rating of 800. All teams start with a rating deviation of 600 and a volatility of 0.6.
2. The 2020 schedule is run through 1 time to give initial ratings. Note that, after this run, the RD remains high and so the ratings are still quite fluid.
3. The 2021 schedule is run through 50 times.

Script for scraping data by [Luke Benz](https://github.com/lbenz730/NCAA_Hoops).
One potential standing issue is that, because of the way the games are scraped, every game is actually considered twice when constructing the ranking. I don't think that this can actually be considered an objectively good or bad thing, but regardless it is probably something that I should fix eventually.
